# Session 003: Analytics Engine

## Objective
Add intelligent analysis that identifies productivity patterns and optimization opportunities beyond raw usage metrics.

## Task 1: Session Correlation Logic (30 minutes)
### Subtasks
1.1 Implement algorithm to group telemetry data into logical development sessions
1.2 Add session outcome tracking (completed, abandoned, blocked)
1.3 Calculate productivity metrics: completion rate, time-to-solution, cost-per-task
1.4 Create session scoring based on efficiency and outcome quality

## Task 2: Pattern Detection Algorithms (40 minutes)
### Subtasks
2.1 Analyze prompt patterns that lead to successful outcomes
2.2 Identify optimal session lengths and break patterns
2.3 Detect cost inefficiencies and suggest optimization opportunities
2.4 Find correlations between AI usage patterns and developer productivity

## Task 3: Enhanced Analytics API (25 minutes)
### Subtasks
3.1 Create endpoints for productivity insights and recommendations
3.2 Add data aggregation with time-based filtering and grouping
3.3 Implement trend analysis for tracking improvement over time
3.4 Generate actionable insights and optimization suggestions

## Task 4: Advanced Visualizations (15 minutes)
### Subtasks
4.1 Add productivity trend charts and pattern analysis displays
4.2 Create cost optimization dashboard with ROI calculations
4.3 Implement session timeline view with outcome correlation
4.4 Add interactive filtering and drill-down capabilities

## Success Criteria
- Analytics engine identifies meaningful productivity patterns from telemetry data
- Provides actionable insights for optimizing AI development workflow
- Dashboard shows trend analysis and ROI calculations
- Pattern detection algorithm suggests concrete optimization strategies

## Notes
- Focus on insights that developers can act on, not just interesting statistics
- Test pattern detection with diverse development session types
- Ensure analytics scale to weeks/months of accumulated data
